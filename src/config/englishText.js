			h1: "Emergency Treatment",
			p1: "Our caring staff is dedicated to making sure that you recieve the care and attention you deserve. Our office is committed to providing personalized care for your entire family to ensure that all your health needs are met.",
			pe: "We offer walk-in care for dental emergencies. Please give our office a call and inform us of your emergency at (714) 879-8118. We will need to modify our schedule of other patients to accomodate your same-day appointment, and some notice is required during busy hours, such as weekends.",
			h4: "Emergency Treatment for Broken or Cracked Tooth",
			p4: "Do not touch or wiggle the remaining tooth. Try to save as many of the original tooth fragments as possible. Apply pressure to the gums near the base of the tooth to stop any bleeding. Make an emergency appointment with us as soon as possible! With prompt treatment, more of the original tooth can be saved.",
			h5: "Dental Pain & Discomfort",
			p5: "If you are experiencing any pain, please make an appointment with us promptly. An examination is required to determine the exact cause of any discomfort and provide appropriate treatment.  Dental pain may be a symptom of inflammation of the gums, a minor cavity, or in serious cases, decay and infection of the interior tooth structure. Dental pain may also result from a physical trauma to the tooth or excessive grinding. Please call our office at (714) 879-8118 to schedule an appointment.",
			h6: "What to Expect from a Dental Exam",
			p6: "The dentist will use a thin dental instrument called an explorer to probe the surface of the teeth, searching for areas of decay and plaque buildup. Large cavities may be easily visible, but developing cavities are often too small to be seen with the naked eye. The dentist will also use a peridontic explorer to evaluate the health of the patient's gums. The entire procedure should only take 10-15 minutes and is entirely pain-free. If the dentist notices signs of a cavity, the patient will be required to take X-Rays to determine if the interior of the tooth is healthy.",
		},
		extraction: {
			h1: "Information about Extractions",
			h2: "When do Teeth Need to be Extracted?",
			p1: "Teeth may need to be extracted for a variety of different reasons. Baby Teeth which are blocking the growth of the patient's adult teeth are removed to ensure that the patient's adult set of teeth develop properly. These teeth do not have strong connections to the root as the adult teeth will, and removing them is typically easier than fully grown adult teeth, especially if they are on top of a growing set of teeth. If a tooth has a very large cavity or a fracture that descends past the gumline, it may be too difficult to repair with a root canal and require extraction.",
			p2: "Our first priority is conservative treatment which will protect and save a patient's existing teeth. However, there are situations where a dental extraction is necessary, such as when a tooth is severely decayed or fractured in multiple locations.",
			h3: "Is it painful?",
			p3: "No, a routine tooth extraction is not painful! Before the procedure, the dentist will apply a topical anaesthetic to the gums to partially numb the area. After a few minutes, the patient will receive an injection to completely numb the part of the mouth where the extraction is performed. You will feel some pressure as the dentist pulls on the tooth to dislodge it from the socket, but the anaesthesia will ensure that the procedure is completely pain-free.",
			h4: "Wisdom Teeth",
			h5: "Why do I need to extract Wisdom Teeth?",
			p4: "Depending on the size of a patient's jaw and the remaining space for the wisdom tooth to grow, there may be a situation in which the wisdom teeth grow in the mouth diagonally or in other molars. Wisdom teeth should be removed if they alter the alignment of the patient's other teeth. If the impacted wisdom teeth are not removed, they can grow diagonally to the other teeth and cause crowding, or they may remain below the gum line, collide with the roots of the adjacent teeth and abrade their neighboring molars."
		},
		prevent: {
			h1: "Preventative Medicine",
			h2: "How can I maintain my dental health?",
			p1: "Brushing and Flossing regularly and avoiding foods that cause tooth decay is the best way to keep teeth healthy. Our office recommends that all patients come in for regular dental screenings even if they do not feel any pain or discomfort. We advise our patients to come in for dental cleanings every 6 months to remove plaque buildup and keep teeth healthy.",
			h3: "Food & Drink that Causes Tooth Decay",
			p2: "Ideally, our teeth should last a life-time of use. All teeth have a protective, highly-mineralized layer of enamel encapsulating the tooth and protecting it from damage. Food and drinks which are high in acidic content, such as orange juice, coffee, and wine, can wear down and stain this layer. Consuming many sugary food or drinks such as bread, candy, or soda without brushing often will create an environment in the teeth where bacteria can grow, causing tartar which can harden into plaque and further tooth decay. Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol can be detrimental to peridontal health, causing the gums to recede and opening up the pockets between the teeth and gums to infection. It is best to consume these types of food and drink in moderation, and to avoid tobacco and alcohol.",
			h4: "Development of Cavities",
			p3: "Dental decay is caused by bacteria which lives in the patient's mouth on the surface of teeth. This bacteria reacts with sugars, which is found in food debris. When bacteria reacts with the sugars, it produces acids which harm the enamel of the teeth. Over time, the acid can soften enamel and create holes exposing the interior of the tooth to bacterial infection.",
			h5: "What is Plaque and Tartar?",
			p4: "Plaque is a film of bacterial that regularly forms on our teeth and must be cleaned by brushing and flossing. If plaque is not cleaned, it will harden into tartar, a mineralized and heavily calcified deposit at the base of the teeth and gumline. At this point, it becomes difficult to remove at home with regular brushing and must be cleaned during an appointment with specialized tools.",
			h6: "Dental Cleanings",
			p5: "All patients should recieve regular dental cleanings to keep teeth healthy and free of infection and tartar. Our office is equipped with modern ultrasonic tools to remove plaque deposits. Dental cleanings are easy, pain free, and a relatively fast procedure - please schedule an appointment with our office soon!",
		},
		filling: {
			h1: "Treatment of Dental Infection Using Fillings",
			p1: "When tooth decay reaches the interior of a tooth, it softens and weakens the surrounding area, structurally comrppomising the tooth. The dentist must clean the tooth by removing all infected tissue using a dental handpiece. This procedure is performed under local anaesthesia so the patient does not feel any pain.",
			h2: "Composite Fillings",
			p2: "After the tooth is cleaned, the structural foundation of the tooth must be reinforced. Cavities are literally holes in the tooth created by bacterial decay, and they must be filled so the tooth can function again. After a tooth has been cleaned, the dentist repairs the tooth by using a composite resin which is similar in color to the patient's teeth, sealing and protecting the tooth.",
			h3: "Inlays & Onlays",
			p3: "Inlays and Onlays are porcelain dental restorations which are crafted in the laboratory to restore integrity to damaged teeth. Inlays cove a single cusp of a tooth, while onlays are more extensive restorations similar to a partial crown.",
			p4: "This treatment will require several office visits - a dental impression mold of the teeth must be taken, and the patient must return in about a week or two to install the restoration.",
			p5: "A severely decayed tooth will lose a significant portion of its structural integrity and may be too weak to support a filling. In most cases, the tooth will need to be reinforced with a crown to continue to be usable. However, a tooth which is not damaged enough to warrant a crown may be repaired with an inlay or onlay.",
		},
		ortho: {
			h1: "Orthopedic Alignment & Personalized Treatment",
			p1: "Our practice specializes in improving the daily lives of our patients who would like to repair the alingmnent of their teeth, and we offer treatment guaranteed to relieve discomfort from misalignment and crowding of the teeth.",
			h2: "How do Braces Modify & Repair the Alignment of My Teeth?",
			p2: "Braces are a proven method to correct dental crowding, over/underbite, protrusion of teeth, and improving the spacing of teeth. If you are unhappy with your dental alignment, please schedule an appointment for a consultation. After examining the patient's bite, the dentist will determine the type of braces the patient requires (Partial or Complete - Upper, Lower, or Both sets of teeth). Braces must be adjusted to properly correct a patient's smile on a case-by-case basis. After a quick examination, the braces can be installed in our office, and should be about an hour.",
			h3: "How long do I need to wear my braces?",
			p3: "This is different for every patient, and depends on how quickly the teeth respond to the braces. For some patients, great results can be seen after the first month. Other patients may need to wear braces for a longer period of time to see the results they are looking for.",
			h4: "How often do I need to come in for adjustments?",
			p3: "After you receive your braces, you will be asked to make monthly visits to our office to replace the rubber bands which create the bond between the teeth and dental brackets, and create the tension which corrects the alignment of your teeth. These bands tend to wear out and need to be replaced so the braces continue to work. The dentist will also be able to look at the progress of the orthadontic treatment and alter the tension and positioning of the braces if necessary."
		},
		implant: {
			h1: "Restorative Dental Bridges",
			p1: "A traditional dental bridge is a restorative technique which can repair a heavily damaged tooth or a gap of missing teeth with replacement prosthetics called 'pontics'. This bridge is anchored on each side by the patient's existing teeth, which must be filed down and crowned.",
			p2: "This procedure requires several visits to our office to complete. A dental impression mold is taken in our office and sent to the laboratory to fabricate your prosthetics. The patient is asked to return after the prosthetics have been fabricated to install the bridge.",
			p3: "The advantage to a dental bridge is that it is significantly more affordable than a full dental implant. Implants require surgery and recovery time as the base of the implant bonds with the patient's jaw.",
			h2: "What is a Dental Implant?",
			p4: "Dental implants are prosthetics which are anchored to the patient's jaw by metal posts. Dental implantats require several visits to our office to complete. During the initial visit, the post must be installed surgically. Recovery time varies between patients. During recovery, the patient may be given a partial denture and a diet of soft foods. When the implant has bonded to the jawbone, the patient returns to have a dental impression taken. When the laboratory fabricates the prosthetic implant, the patient returns to connect the implant with the metallic post at the base of the gums.",
		},
		root: {
			h1: "Information about Root Canals",
			h2: "Why do I need a Root Canal?",
			p1: "A Root Canal is required when a tooth contains a deep cavity, or when a tooth has been severely damaged by impact. If a small cavity or minor infection is ignored and left untreated, the infection will move into the pulp of the tooth, and then towards surrounding bone and tissues. The pulp contains nerve endings, vascular tissue, and connections which nourish and keep the organic part of the tooth alive. When an infection becomes this severe, simply cleaning out the surface of the tooth and applying a filling is not enough to treat the infection, since it has moved deeper into the root of the tooth. This is why it is suggested to visit your dentist regularly and take care of any small cavities before they can become more painful. When the infection is this severe, it is necessary to clean out the root canals of the tooth with a special instrument called a dental file.",
			h3: "Is it painful?",
			p2: "Patients coming in for a Root Canal receive anaesthesia, so this procedure will be pain-free.",
			h4: "What happens to my tooth after Root Canal Treatment?",
			p3: "When the dentist removes the pulp of a tooth, the living tissue which nourished the tooth will be gone. A root canal will save a tooth from serious infection by removing the infected pulp - however, without pulp, a tooth will weaken over time. It is often necessary to apply a protective crown to the tooth after a root canal treatment."

		},
		crown: {
			h1: "Crowns",
			h2: "What is a Dental Crown?",
			p1: "A crown is a protective cap which is placed on teeth which have lost structural integrity due to extensive infection or damage. The outer portion of the tooth is filed down with specialized tools so the crown can be properly fitted. A dental impression mold is taken and sent to the laboratory. The mold is used by the laboratory to shape the crown for each patient. Before the patient leaves the office, the dentist sculpts a temporary crown which can be worn until the actual crown is finished and sent back from the lab. When the laboratory delivers the finished crown, the patient returns to the office to have the crown fitted and adjusted so the bite feels natural.",
			h3: "Why do I Need a Crown?",
			p2: "After a Root Canal treatment, the infected tooth is cleaned of infected tissue. However, since much of the organic material and surface enamel which supported the tooth is cleared to reach the infection, the remaining tooth becomes brittle and sensitive to force and temperature. It is necessary to strengthen the tooth by replacing the lost bone and dentin with a zirconium or porcelain material that can shield the tooth from impact and temperature changes.",
			h4: "Zirconia and Porcelain-Metal (PFM) Crowns",
			p3: "Our office offers Zirconia crowns as well as Porcelain Fused to Metal (PFM). Zirconia crowns are extremely resillient and resistant to temperature and chewing forces. Zirconia crowns also offer a more aesthetically pleasing appearance which matches the patient's other natural teeth. Porcelain Fused to Metal crowns are cheaper to install, but the metallic materials may cause allergies in some patients, and may require removing more natural bone material for the fitting.",			
		},
		white: {
			h1: "Dental Whitening",
			p1: "Whitening is a popular and effective procedure to restore shine and brightness to your smile. Eating acidic foods and beverages such as tomatoes, coffee, and wine weakens the enamel of teeth, which will reveal underlying layers of dentin, which is slightly yellow in appearance. In addition, eating and drinking pigmented foods and beverages also tends to stain teeth. Fortunately, our office is able to reverse this discoloration with a quick and easy in-office whitening procedure.",
			h2: "How does it work?",
			p2: "After a protective coating is applied to the gums, a whitening gel is applied to the teeth. A powerful UV light is used to initialize a chemical reaction which significantly improves the appearance of discolored and yellow teeth immediately.",
			h3: "How long does it last?",
			p3: "The benefits of a whitening procedure will last for as long as the patient avoids food and drinks which stain teeth. After whitening, patients need to take care to avoid drinking coffee, wine, and other foods which discolor teeth."
